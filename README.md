Install [the Go programming language](https://golang.org/) on Linux with this command, changing the version to your desired Go version:

`$goversion=1.9.2; git clone https://github.com/gonutz/getgo.git; chmod u+x getgo/getgo; sudo getgo/getgo; rm -r getgo`

This will install the 32 bit Linux version and set the `GOPATH` to the folder `go` in your user's home folder.
